# Mini CGI Library

This mini library provides a simple framework for creating and managing pixmaps, making it ideal for learning about CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) algorithms. The library includes functions for creating, modifying, and deleting a pixel map, as well as saving the data to a file.

## Features

- **Pixmap Creation**: Define a blank pixmap with specified width and height.
- **Pixmap Clearing**: Set all pixels in the pixmap to a single color.
- **Pixmap Deletion**: Free up memory resources used by a pixmap.
- **Pixmap Dumping**: Save the pixmap data to a binary file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a C compiler (such as `gcc`) to compile this library.
